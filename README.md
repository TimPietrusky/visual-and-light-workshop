## Preparations

A list of suggestions that will make your time at the workshop even more productive:

* Bring a computer
* Check if your computer runs the latest version of each application: 
  * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
  * [modV](https://modv.js.org/guide/)
  * [luminave](https://github.com/NERDDISCO/luminave)

### Nice to have

The following suggestions are totally optional, so please don't worry if you can't fulfill them: 

* Coding experience  
  * We will help you if you have no idea at all
* MIDI controller that can be connected via USB to the computer
  * We will have some spare MIDI controllers for you to use, but if you want to buy one we can recommend the [KORG nanoKONTROL 2](https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/nanokontrol2/) because it comes for a reasonable price, is portable & has a lot of buttons, faders and knobs
